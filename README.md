Pop'n controller set out for 1u keys
2 types of single PCB, and a dual layer LED version. This will take some time to fill with all the files as I wouldn't give what's needed to get them made without having some to show they work

i've known plenty of people play AC dumps right on their keyboard. we can do better surely?

i originally wanted to make a business card where the design ended up about the size of a credit card. it worked fine but it wasn't very practical. in playing with the Pico sized Pop'n controllers 1u keys are too spaced out.

i own an official AC size controller i imported from Japan. very expensive, not good enough - so i bought one from Yuancon and love it. but the size is too much, the domed buttond and the size of it (similar to my full sized sdvx etc i guess) the controller gets put away and playing the game isn't as casual and easy as it could be. making other people's pocket/pico ocntrollers brought back the spontaneous fun, set out right to be easy to feel your way around, good reliable switches... the fun came back... pick it up and put it down whenever, but most importantly just naturally pick it up more.

it also became apparent the keys not being round or domed didn't really make a massive difference, its not as if the UI gets confusing due to not matching,. it works fine.
